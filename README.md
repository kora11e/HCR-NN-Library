# HCR-NN Library

Repository for contributors from **AIntern** co-developing the HCR-NN library.

## Introduction

The **HCR-NN Library** is a Python package that provides a practical and automated implementation of the **Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction (HCR)** model.  
It combines statistical modeling with neural network components to enable efficient density estimation, conditional probability computation, and advanced multivariate data analysis.  

The library is designed for researchers, data scientists, and engineers who require precise probabilistic modeling tools with flexible architecture for experimentation and real-world applications.
